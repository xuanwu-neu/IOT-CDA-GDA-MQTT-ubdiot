# Semester Project Documentation

## For the Project Proposal

Edit README-PROPOSAL.md and commit the update for your proposal work.
Include the link to your repo from GitHub Classroom in your Canvas
submission.

## For the Project Deliverable

Edit README-PROJECT.md and commit the update for your project submission.
Your project submission will go hand-in-hand with your chapter12 branch
updates for both python-components and java-components.

If you implement a Lambda function in Python, just include it with your
python-components chapter12 branch; whereas if you implement a Lambda
function in Java, just include it with your java-components chapter12 branch.

If you choose to implement your Semester Project and / or cloud functionality
in a different language, such as JavaScript, you will need to create a separate
repository and give the TA's read-only access so they can review your work.

Include the link to your repo from GitHub Classroom in your Canvas
submission.
