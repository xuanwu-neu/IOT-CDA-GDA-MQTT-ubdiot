# Gateway Device App Exercises (java-components)

If you're a student of Connected Devices, this is the place where
you'll capture the artifacts for each Lab Module.

Use this directory to store your Chapter-specific exercise content
(design diagrams, reports, etc.) and use the README.md within each
chapter directory to summarize your work using the template given.
If you're not familiar with Markdown language, it's very easy to
learn and use. See the [GitHub tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for more information.

The numbering scheme for Exercises, Lab Modules, and Chapters in
the [Programming the Internet of Things](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-the-internet/9781492081401/) book are the same.
That is, Chapter 01 in the book maps to Exercise 01, which maps
to Lab Module 01.

Lastly, all exercises and issues (requirements) are part of the
[Programming the Internet of Things](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-the-internet/9781492081401/) book, and are documented
and kept up-to-date [here on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/programming-the-iot/projects/1).

Have fun!
