# Gateway Device Application (Connected Devices)

## Lab Module 01

Be sure to implement all the PIOT-GDA-* issues (requirements) listed at [PIOT-INF-01-001 - Chapter 01](https://github.com/orgs/programming-the-iot/projects/1#column-9974937).

### Description

NOTE: Include two full paragraphs describing your implementation approach by answering the questions listed below.

What does your implementation do? 

Set up environment for java, git clone GDA project from github, Import GDA project into 
Eclipse, then run unit test and integration test. 

How does your implementation work?

The GDA can be ran as supposed, and All unit test and integration test were passed as they were supposed.

### Code Repository and Branch

NOTE: Be sure to include the branch (e.g. https://github.com/programming-the-iot/python-components/tree/alpha001).

URL: https://github.com/NU-CSYE6530-Fall2020/gateway-device-app-xuanwu-neu/tree/alpha001

### UML Design Diagram(s)

NOTE: Include one or more UML designs representing your solution. It's expected each
diagram you provide will look similar to, but not the same as, its counterpart in the
book [Programming the IoT](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-the-internet/9781492081401/).

### Unit Tests Executed

NOTE: TA's will execute your unit tests. You only need to list each test case below
(e.g. ConfigUtilTest, DataUtilTest, etc). Be sure to include all previous tests, too,
since you need to ensure you haven't introduced regressions.

- ConfigUtilTest
- 
- 

### Integration Tests Executed

NOTE: TA's will execute most of your integration tests using their own environment, with
some exceptions (such as your cloud connectivity tests). In such cases, they'll review
your code to ensure it's correct. As for the tests you execute, you only need to list each
test case below (e.g. SensorSimAdapterManagerTest, DeviceDataManagerTest, etc.)

- GatewayDeviceAppTest
